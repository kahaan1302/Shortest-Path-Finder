# Shortest-Path-Finder
Overview This mini project implements the A* (A-star) search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The A* algorithm is a popular and efficient pathfinding algorithm used in various applications such as robotics, game development, and AI.

Features Implementation of the A* search algorithm Visualization of the search process on a grid Adjustable grid size Customizable start and goal positions Support for obstacles Requirements Python 3.x matplotlib (for visualization) numpy (for handling grid operations)
